# Medhacks-Challenge

I worked on developing the Posture Detection and Recognition approach for Medhacks 2021, organized by John Hopkins University as part of the Major League Hackathon.
Our submission for the event involved creating a prototype of an app with interactive simulations to make the process of registering information more interesting. Through the app, we would also monitor the posture through the camera, and asking certain questions as per HIPAA guidelines. Through this, we aimed to detect early signs of Cardiac arrests in the elderly population, as caregiving for them is limited if they are staying alone or in remote areas.

We had 72 hours to come up with a prototype during the hackathon, and through our submission, we secured 3rd position in the Health and Data Science track of Medhacks 2021.
